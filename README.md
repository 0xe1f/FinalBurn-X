===========

FinalBurn X is a port of [FinalBurn Alpha](http://www.barryharris.me.uk/fba.php)
to OS X. The goal of FinalBurn is the emulation of Capcom Systems I, II, III and SNK Neo Geo.

(The screenshot doesn't belong to any of the four,
[but I couldn't resist the reference](https://github.com/0xe1f/CocoaMSX/))

To Play
-------

1. Launch the emulator
2. Import ROM sets by dropping them into the Launcher window (see
[Limitations](#limitations) below).

Controls
--------

Capcom:
`1`,`5`,`A`,`S`,`D`,`Z`,`X`,`C` for 
`1P Start`,`1P Coin`,`Jab`,`Strong`,`Fierce`,`Short`,`Forward` and `Roundhouse`,
respectively.

Neo Geo:
`1`,`5`,`Z`,`X`,`C`,`V` for `1P Start`,`1P Coin`,`A`,`B`,`C` and `D`,
respectively.

Limitations
-----------

When dropping multiple files, ensure that each set is ZIP-compressed, and that all sets are
supported by the emulator. Only CPS I, II, III and Neo-Geo sets are currently supported.

Note that to play Neo Geo games, the Neo Geo BIOS (`neogeo.zip`) is required.
