FinalBurn X is a port of [FinalBurn Alpha][1] to OS X. The goal of FinalBurn X is the emulation of Capcom Systems I, II, III and SNK Neo Geo.

The emulator is not yet finished, but is playable for most (all?) CPS I/II/III games. To play:

1. Create a directory called `roms` in the same folder as the executable
2. Copy ROM zip files to that directory - following the same naming convention as the other versions of FinalBurn

No other archive formats are supported, including plain uncompressed folders.

Controls are currently fixed and not configurable - `1`,`5`,`A`,`S`,`D`,`Z`,`X`,`C` for `1P Start`, `1P Coin`, `Jab`, `Strong`, `Fierce`, `Short`, `Forward` and `Roundhouse`, respectively.
