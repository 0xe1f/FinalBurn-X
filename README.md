FinalBurn X
===========

FinalBurn X is a port of [FinalBurn Alpha][1] to OS X. The goal of FinalBurn X
is the emulation of Capcom Systems I, II, III and SNK Neo Geo.

The emulator is not yet finished, but is playable for most CPS I/II/III games.
To play:

1. Create a directory called `roms` in the Application Support directory of 
FinalBurn X - normally `~/Library/Application Support/FinalBurnX/`. The 
`roms` directory will be automatically created the first time you run the
emulator
2. Copy ROM file archives to that directory - following the same naming 
convention as the other versions of FinalBurn
3. If the emulator is already running, restart it to update the list of ROMs

Currently, the only supported format for ROMs is ZIP - 7zip and plain folders
(uncompressed) are not supported.

Controls are currently fixed and not configurable. They are:

`1`,`5`,`A`,`S`,`D`,`Z`,`X`,`C` for 
`1P Start`,`1P Coin`,`Jab`,`Strong`,`Fierce`,`Short`,`Forward` and `Roundhouse`,
respectively.
